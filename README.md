#Task 1
Before he was famous, Peter Parker studied at Computers and Automatics and was very ambitious. That is why he wants to score full marks of credits score this semester.

His courses on the first semester:

IOCLA
Electronics
Sports
Python

Read from the keyboard the number of credit of every course (integers), then output the sum of the number of credits Peter has to obtain:

Example:

Input:
5
5
2
6

Output:
18

#Task 2

Peter Parker is a photographer at Daily Bugle and he can't remember his email address used to send his boss, J. Jonah Jameson, the best photographs of Spider Man.

He knows it's the same as his personal address and contains @nydailybugle.com instead ofe @gmail.com. Write a program that helps Peter Parker always remember this email address.

#Task 3

Peter Parker is very ambitious and he hopes to go to MIT. For this, he needs to send to MIT his average grade.

Write a program that receives from keyboard Peter's european average grade and returns the grade in american system, as it follows: 

[9, 10] -> A

[8, 9) -> B

[7, 8) -> C

[6, 7) -> D

[5, 6) -> E

[1, 5) -> F

Remarks:

His grade may NOT be an integer number.

If the grade is outside the intervals presented above, the next text will be outputted: "Wrong grade!"

#Task 4

Make a program that reads from keyboard a number N, and then N triplets of X Y T form. Output, on a single line, depending on T, the following:

t = 'i' -> the result of X divided by Y division as integer numbers
t = 'f' -> the result of X divided by Y as real numbers
t = 'p' -> the result of X at the power of Y

Example:

Input:
3

3 2 i

13 2 f

5 3 p

Output:

1 6.5 125

#Task 5

Read from keyboard a pozitive integer number N. For every integers i from the interval [0, N], output the square of i, if i is even, contrary, output i at the power of 3. Output the results on a single line.

Example : N = 4 -> 0 1 4 27 16

#Task 6

Read from keyboard two natural numbers - N1 and N2, with N1 < N2. Output, on a single line, the even numbers between the [N1, N2] interval.

Example: N1 = 2; N2 = 11 -> 4 6 8 10

#Task 7

Peter Parker is fascinated about his double life he has as a superhero. He wants to learn everything the can about his enemies. Help peter to filter through a series of newspapers.

The program receives a title of an article and the name of a villain. Verify if the name of the villain exists in the newspaper article title. If yes, output the next text: length_of_title + ' : ' + 'We found ' + name_of_villain.

Exemple: 'Doctor Octopus strikes again! NY is in danger!', 'Doctor Octopus' -> '51 : We found Doctor Octopus.'

#Task 8

In his last day before he becomes a superhero, Peter discovered palindromes. A palindrom is equal with it's inverse number ( example : 12321).

Given a natural number N, write a program that helps Peter to find out if a number is a palindrome or not and output the following text: ("N is palindrome" or "N is not palindrome").

Exemple:

N = 1234 -> "1234 is not palindrome"
N = 2789872 -> "2789872 is palindrome"

#Task 9

Living a double life as a anonym sueperhero in NY, Peter Parkes wishes to study his original powers. He starts a series of notes about spyders reproduction. He discovered that a pair of spyders produces every day a new pair of spyders which becomes productive at the age of one day. Determine the number of pairs of spyders after N days. Peter found out that his discoveries matches the Fibonacci series.

Read from the keyboard a positive integer number N, >0 then output the N termen of Fibonacci series which represents the number on pairs of spyders after N days.

Exemple: N = 10 -> 55
